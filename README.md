#OFF WORLD
THIS IS A WIP!

inspired by sci-fi, web1.0, and the millions of pokémon cards decaying on what's left of old earth, off world is the neon-tinged 'magic: the gathering' of the post-apocolypse.

basically, i thought it would be fun to make an online trading card game. here is what i've got so far!

SIGN UP!

you don't have to use a real e-mail or anything but i highly suggest picking a fun avatar!

CHECK OUT YOUR CARDS!

just for signing up you get 20 sweet cards which coincidentally are the only cards in existence so far...

PLAY THE GAME!

for the sake of this demo you will play as player1. eventually you will be able to play against your friends on two different screens but as of now your friend can play as the formidable player2 and you can take turns attacking each other on one screen. nifty!

THE RULES!

Preparation
              
Each player starts the game with 30 Health and 0 Mana slots.
Each player starts with a deck of 20 Damage cards
From the deck each player receives 3 random cards as his initial hand
The player who goes first is chosen at random

Gameplay

The active player receives 1 Mana slot per turn for up to a maximum of 10 total slots
The active player’s empty Mana slots are refilled each turn
The active player draws one random card from his deck
The active player can play as many cards as he can afford
Any played card empties Mana slots and deals immediate damage to the opponent player
If the opponent player’s Health drops to or below zero the active player wins the game

tl;dr: click the glowing stuff till someone wins!
